If you need to have better control, DataStax is better.I also did a prototype with Google Spanner in one of the recent innovation days, it provides the best of both worlds but being a service on Google Cloud Platform(GCP) works if your services are primarily on GCP. <a href=\"https://www.trustradius.com/products/amazon-aurora/reviews\" class=\"product-link\" target=\"_blank\" data-id=\"5463c14b2969e30800e8f2c0\">Amazon Aurora</a> is a relational database with higher performance and is a good candidate if search and default relational behavior is preferred.For now, DataStax worked well for us as it provides best in class performance across different kinds of read/write/mixed workloads. It provides linear scalability which works for the best performance, lowest latency and highest throughput. If configured correctly, there is no downtime and no data loss.</p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{"alternative_id":9385}}
