Currently GumGum reaches 1 billion unique visitors per month using 3 Cassandra datacenters in Amazon Web Services (AWS) spread across the globe. This presentation details how we scaled out from one local Cassandra datacenter to a multi-datacenter Cassandra cluster and all the problems we encountered and choices we made while implementing it.&#13;\n &#13;\nHow did we architect multi-region Cassandra in AWS? What were our experiences in implementing multi-datacenter Cassandra? How did we achieve low latency with multi-region Cassandra and the Datastax Driver? What are the different Cassandra use cases at GumGum? How did we integrate our Cassandra with Spark?\"</p></div></div></div>"}}]}},"pageContext":{"alternative_id":9035}}
