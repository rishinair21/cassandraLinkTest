According to Shodan, there are currently over 2,600 Cassandra database instances left accessible online.</p><p>Since the start of the year, multiple criminal groups have been hijacking database servers left unprotected online, wiping data and requesting a ransom payment.</p><p>First attacks hit <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mongodb-apocalypse-professional-ransomware-group-gets-involved-infections-reach-28k-servers/\" target=\"_blank\">MongoDB servers</a> and were quickly followed by attacks against <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mongodb-hijackers-move-on-to-elasticsearch-servers/\" target=\"_blank\">ElasticSearch clusters</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/database-ransom-attacks-hit-couchdb-and-hadoop-servers/\" target=\"_blank\">Hadoop servers and CouchDB databases</a>.</p><p>All previous attacks have been tracked by Victor Gevers and other members of the GDI.foundation, who created spreadsheets that keep track of ongoing attacks.</p><p>One such spreadsheet is available for Cassandra attacks.
