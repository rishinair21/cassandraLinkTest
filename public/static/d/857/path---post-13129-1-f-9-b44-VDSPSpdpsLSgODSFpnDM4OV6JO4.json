You should assess and understand these limitations  before committing to Cassandra as a technology, and align your rollout of Cassandra with this understanding to ensure that future performance and ongoing operations are within your expected bounds.</p><p><a href=\"https://opencredo.com/?p=28630\">Patterns of Successful Cassandra Data Modelling</a><strong> </strong>By Alla Babkina</p><p>A growing number of clients are asking OpenCredo for help with using Apache Cassandra and solving specific problems they encounter. Clients have different use cases, requirements, implementation and teams but their similar issues. We have noticed that Cassandra data modelling problems are the most consistent cause of Cassandra failing to meet their expectations. Data modelling is one of the most complex areas of using Cassandra and has many considerations</p><p><a href=\"https://opencredo.com/?p=28840\">How Not To Use Cassandra Like An RDBMS (and what will happen if you do)</a> By Dominic Fox</p><p>Cassandra isn’t a relational database management system, but it has some features that make it look a bit like one. In this post, Dominic reviews a few example scenarios where a beginner might be unpleasantly surprised by the differences, and suggests some remedies.</p><p><a href=\"https://opencredo.com/?p=28750\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Common Problems with Cassandra Tombstones</a> By Alla Babkina</p><p>Cassandra is optimised for writes and everything, including logical deletion of data, results in extra records being inserted. Every deletion in Cassandra results in a tombstone, a record marking deletion. We have noticed that lack of understanding of tombstones is often the root cause of production issues our clients experience with Cassandra. We have decided to share a compilation of the most common problems with Cassandra tombstones and some practical advice on solving them.</p></div></div></section><section class=\"bg-white text-blue pt-60 pb-60\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"flex flex-wrap w-full lg:w-5/6 justify-center\"><div class=\"owl-carousel owl-carousel-insights flex items-stretch mb-30 md:mb-30 pl-0 sm:pl-30 pr-0 sm:pr-30 lg:pl-0 lg:pr-0\"><div class=\"bg-orange h-full\"><a href=\"https://opencredo.com/blogs/riak-the-dynamo-paper-and-life-beyond-basho/\" title=\"Read More\"><img src=\"https://15rf562os5r61q4tvf2630fw-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/banner-case-studies-297x236.jpg\" alt=\"Riak, the Dynamo paper and life beyond Basho\" class=\"block w-full\" /></a><div class=\"text-white p-30\"><p class=\"text-18 mb-30\"><a href=\"https://opencredo.com/blogs/riak-the-dynamo-paper-and-life-beyond-basho/\" class=\"text-white no-underline font-bold\">Riak, the Dynamo paper and life beyond Basho</a></p>Recently, the sad news has emerged that Basho, which developed the Riak distributed database, has gone into receivership.
